# Style guide
PEP 8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the Python Enhancement Proposal for how to style Python code. It covers indentation, maximum line length, blank lines, imports, and more. Using the **flake8** package, you can check that code conforms to PEP 8 as well as checking for errors and overly complex code.

## Exercise
Execute the Python code to show it works, then run flake8 and fix the issues. Make sure it still works after you've applied the fixes.
